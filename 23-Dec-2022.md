### EBS
- Elastic Block Store volume: **network** (not a physical) drive
- **persist** data, even after instance termination
- only be mounted to one instance
- bound to a **specific availability zone**
- Analogy: "network USB stick"

#### EBS Volume
- network drive
  - use network to communicate - might be a bit of latency
  - can be **detach** from an EC2 instance, and **attached** to another one quickly
- locked to an AZ
  - to move a volume across AZ, first need to snapshot it
- capacity needs be provisioned: size in GBs, and IOPS

#### EBS - Delete on Termination attribute
- By default, the root EBS volume is deleted
- By default, any other attached EBS volume is not deleted
- Can be controlled by AWS console/CLI. Use case: preserve root volume when instance is terminated.
