### Amazon EC2
- EC2 instance is a virtual server
- on Windows, Linux, or MacOS
- EC2 hosts are managed by AWS
- instance type: CPU, memory, storage and networking

#### Launching an EC2 Instance
- An **AMI** defines configuration of the instance
- AMI is created from an EBS **snapshot**
- An EBS **snapshot** is a point-in-time backup of an instance
- Flow:

A[Create an instance and configure it] --> B[Create a snapshot] --> C[Create an AMI from the snapshot as a customized AMI] --> D[Create new instances from the AMI, which will have the same configuration]
```
- Related security and network resources
    - **Security Group** controls inbound & outbound traffic
    - **Internet Gateway** (VPC level) enables access to/from the Internet

#### Benifits of Amazon EC2
* Elastic computing
* Complete control
* Flexible
- AWS CLI configured with access keys
- Access keys is associated with an IAM user
- The Access key uses permissions assigned to the IAM user, i.e. access S3.
- Downside:  stored in the file system of EC2 instances, insecure.
- **Instance profile**: a way to connect an IAM role to an EC2 instance
    - The role is assumed by the EC2 instance
    - The instance gains access to resources that the role is permitted.
* Reliable
* Secure - Fully integrated with VPC and security features
* Inexpensive
#### EC2 user data and Metadata
- **user data** is run when the instance starts for the first time
- **Metadata** is data about the EC2 instance

#### EC2 placement groups
- Cluster: **low-latency**, **tightly-coulped** **HPC application**, **high throughput** network traffic
- Partition: spread instances across partitions. Instances in one partition do not share the underlying hardware with instances in different partition. Used by **distributed and replicated workloads** i.e Hadoop, Cassandra, Kafka.
- Spread: **all** instances are on **different** hardwares
#### Network Interfaces (ENI, ENA, EFA)
#### Public, Private and Elastic IP Addresses
